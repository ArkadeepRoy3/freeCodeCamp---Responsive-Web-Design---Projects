# Description - Cat Photo App: 

## This is the first project I created using HTML as a part of the freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Certification course.
## Used HTML tags such as h1, section, ul(unordered lists), img, legend, label, input and more.
## This HTML page uses images of cute cats and also links to other pages and images.
## This page also utilizes an HTML form to collect user data.
